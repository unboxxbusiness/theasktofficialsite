            At Theaskt.org, our goal is to make learning accessible, safe, and
            fair for women and girls across India. This policy explains the
            terms for refunds and cancellations for paid programs offered by
            Theaskt Learning Trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            By enrolling in any paid course, program, workshop, membership, or
            subscription, you agree to the terms below.

          <p>
            If a learner requests cancellation before course access is granted
            (LMS login/activation not completed), a refund may be issued after
            necessary verification.

          <p>

          </p>

          <h2>Refund Eligibility After Course Access</h2>
          <p>
            Because our programs include downloadable content, community
            access, and digital learning benefits, refunds after LMS access is
            activated are limited.

            <li>You were charged incorrectly due to a system/payment error</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A refund cannot be issued if:</p>

            <li>You changed your mind after starting the course</li>
            <li>You are unable to make time for learning</li>

            <li>You expected guaranteed income, job, or results (not promised)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If applicable, Theaskt.org may provide partial refunds after
